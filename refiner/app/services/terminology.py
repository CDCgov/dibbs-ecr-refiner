# NOTE:
# This file establishes a consistent pattern for handling terminology data:
# 1. A `Payload` class (e.g., ConfigurationPayload) holds raw DB models.
# 2. A `Processed` class (e.g., ProcessedConfiguration) holds the final, ready-to-use data.
# 3. The `Processed` class has a `.from_payload()` factory method that contains all
#    the logic to transform the raw payload into the processed version.
# 4. The `Processed` class has a `.build_xpath()` method for the refiner.
# This separates data fetching, data processing, and data usage into clean, testable steps.

    Model representing the raw configuration data needed for refinement.

    This model is intentionally minimal to support both inline testing (from configuration building)
    and independent testing (from demo.py processing) patterns. The model focuses on just the
    essential data needed for refinement:

    - conditions: A list of all DbCondition objects to be considered.
    - configuration: The specific DbConfiguration object, which may contain custom codes.

    Note on Testing Patterns:
    - Independent testing: Uses RC SNOMED codes from the RR's coded information organizer to find
      the matching configuration. The RC SNOMED code comes from the RR, not the configuration itself.
    - Inline testing: Directly uses a configuration to test against input data, focusing only on
      the codes defined in that configuration.

      that Configuration's codes.
