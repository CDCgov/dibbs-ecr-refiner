# Sample Data By Jurisdiction

The script in this directory is used to create copies of the sample file provided by the eCR Refiner team that are modified to work on a per-jurisdiction basis.

After running the script the `output_zips` directory  will contain a testing file for every jurisdiction listed in the `eCR_Jurisdictions.csv` file, plus a few additional "jurisdictions" (`APHL`, `CDC`, and `TEST`).
